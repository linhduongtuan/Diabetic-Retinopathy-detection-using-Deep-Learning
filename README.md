Dataset under consideration - EyePacs dataset provided by kaggle

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world.It is estimated to 
affect over 93 million people.

Clinicians can identify DR by the presence of lesions associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease. While this 
approach is effective, its resource demands are high.The expertise and equipment required are often lacking in areas where the rate 
of diabetes in local populations is high and DR detection is most needed.As the number of individuals with diabetes continues to grow, 
the infrastructure needed to prevent blindness due to DR will become even more insufficient.

About the Dataset - 

A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:
0 - No DR
1 - Mild
2 - Moderate
3 - Severe
4 - Proliferative DR
